A description of some of these standing committees are listed below. It may be a good idea to [*become a friend*](https://www.mytrb.org/Committees/SelfNominationAsFriend) of a committee that you are interested in.

**Standing Committee on Transportation Planning Policy and Processes (AEP10)**

Scope: The Standing Committee for Transportation Planning Policy and Processes (AEP10) addresses the dynamic institutional relationships and interactive processes associated with transportation planning and its governance stakeholders. It supports the critical role of developing, managing and implementing long range plans (both within the traditional transportation planning process as well as within a multitude of related topics), as well as policy development, performance management and research across all transportation modes. The committee also provides an objective, collaborative forum to explore all related facets of transportation planning including strategic, technical and consensus building roles.

Chair: William Frawley  [b-frawley@tti.tamu.edu](mailto:b-frawley@tti.tamu.edu)

**Standing Committee on Transportation Planning Analysis and Application (AEP15)**

Scope: The Standing Committee for Transportation Planning Methods and Applications focuses on traditional, new and/or improved transportation planning methods and techniques, with an emphasis on their practical application for transportation planning across the range of rural, small and medium sized urban areas, as well as large metropolitan areas and mega regions. The Committee expressly promotes participation in the research process and fosters the close linkage of analytic methods with modeling and other forms of technical planning practices that have tangible benefits for real-world applications including translation of technical data and information to inform discussion and debates about broad community based policy decisions.. This includes networking and the exchange of ideas among researchers, practitioners and experts in other relevant fields of study that have tangible benefits for real-world applications. 

Chair: Hannah Twaddell  [hannah.twaddell@icf.com](mailto:hannah.twaddell@icf.com)

**Standing Committee on Transportation Needs of National Parks and Public Lands (AEP20)**

Scope: The Committee is concerned with the role of transportation in providing access to and mobility within National Parks, other Federal Land Management Agencies (FLMAs) such as the U.S. Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management, as well as other public lands such as state parks.  It provides a forum for representatives from transportation and land management agencies, tourism groups, universities, consultants, and public officials to share information on a variety of management issues regarding access, circulation, travel modes, safety, congestion, planning, asset management, operations, maintenance and wayfinding on public lands. In addition, the Committee identifies research, data collection and performance needs related to managing recreational travel and tourism.  Because transportation and its role is driven by individual missions of the respective agencies, research and implementation of items at the field level can present unique challenges and opportunities across the spectrum to share findings and advance the practice of transportation in these natural settings.  This Committee provides an excellent forum to articulate those considerations and coalesce around key research directions and critical research issues brought forth by TRB. 

Chair: Natalie Villwock-Witte  [n.villwockwitte@montana.edu](mailto:n.villwockwitte@montana.edu)

**Standing Committee on Travel Survey Methods (AEP25)**

Scope: The committee focuses on all types of travel or activity surveys, including those pertaining to motorized and non-motorized travel; household and commercial travel; travel involving single or multiple occupancy vehicles; and workplace, visitor, or recreational travel. In terms of these various types of surveys, the committee is concerned with survey design, sampling, instrument development, data collection, data processing, data analysis, and reporting of results. 

Chair: Zachary Patterson  [Zachary.Patterson@concordia.ca](mailto:Zachary.Patterson@concordia.ca)

**Standing Committee on Traveler Behavior and Values (AEP30)**

Scope: The committee will be concerned with promoting research and disseminating research results on traveler values, attitudes, and behavior. Traveler values and attitudes refer to motivational, cognitive, situation and disposition factors determining human behavior. Traveler behavior refers primarily to the modeling and analysis of travel demand, based on theories from a variety of scientific fields. These include but are not limited to time use and activity-based approaches, longitudinal methods, and spatial behavior at any level of aggregation (e.g., individual, household, community, and so forth). The committee will serve as a forum for the development, testing, and dissemination of new interdisciplinary methods of inquiry. 

Chair: Khandker Nurul Habib  [khandker.nurulhabib@utoronto.ca](mailto:khandker.nurulhabib@utoronto.ca)

**Standing Committee on Effects of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) on Travel Choices (AEP35)**

Scope: The committee aims to advance our understanding of the complex interrelationships between Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) and activity-travel choices. The committee is interested in conceptual, methodological, experimental, and empirical studies addressing topics including, but not limited to, telecommuting, e-shopping, e-hailing, real-time information, social-media, various apps available on mobile devices, and the use of virtual/augmented reality and gamification to understand behavior. 

Chair: Giovanni Circella  [gcircella@ucdavis.edu](mailto:gcircella@ucdavis.edu)

**Standing Committee on Transportation Network Modeling (AEP40)** 

Scope: The committee will promote research and information exchange in transportation network modeling, an interdisciplinary field spanning Computer Science, Logistics, Mathematics, Operations Research, Telecommunications, and Transportation Science.  The committee will also focus on: the understanding and modeling of the technological and behavioral factors affecting the performance of transportation systems; modeling the interactions between the infrastructure and transportation networks; and the development and use of models to evaluate the quantity and quality of transportation facilities and services. The committee will serve as a focus for the development, adaptation, and implementation of quantitative and computer-based methodologies for the above purposes. The committee will cut across traditional modal boundaries, seeking unifying conceptual and methodological frameworks, yet highlighting modal differences. As such, it will foster effective and rapid sharing of information and experiences among researchers, practitioners, regulators and decision makers. 

Chair: Yanfeng Ouyang  [yfouyang@illinois.edu](mailto:yfouyang@illinois.edu)

**Standing Committee on Transportation Demand Forecasting (AEP50)**

Scope: The focus of this committee includes the development, application, and dissemination of improved demand forecasting techniques, within the integrated context of the interaction of transportation demand with the land-use form, demographic composition, and technological state of the activity-travel environment. All aspects related to theory, data estimation, and application are of direct interest to the committee, with an emphasis on research developments that have the potential to be implemented in the near future. 

Chair: Elizabeth Sall  [easall@gmail.com](mailto:easall@gmail.com)

**Standing Committee on Transportation Demand Management (AEP60)**

Scope: The Transportation Demand Management Committee focuses on research and application of strategies for modifying travel behavior to achieve more equitable mobility outcomes while making better, more efficient use of transportation infrastructure. These strategies include, but are not limited to: pricing, behavioral incentives, parking and curbside management, mobility-as a-service, and supporting modes like transit, walking, biking, and sharing rides. The committee is also focused on the development and integration of new technologies to provide travel information to users and enable next generation mobility options.
