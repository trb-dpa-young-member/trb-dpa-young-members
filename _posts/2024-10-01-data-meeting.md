Hi all,

We’re looking forward to hosting this virtual meeting on October 8, 2:30-3:30 ET / 1:30-2:30 CT.

We will have two presenters - Dr. Atiyya Shaw’s (University of Michigan) research focuses on user-centered data stream integration and utilization, transportation survey design and analysis, and human factors engineering. Han Bao (WSP) specializes in road safety and Vision Zero.

More information to follow as we get closer to the date. I will send invites to hold this spot on calendars.
